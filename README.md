# TF-Tutorials

I don't have much time to write out what I'm doing, but I'll explain it as best I can:

First off, I'm going back to school for a MS in CS on the ML track with a focus in Computational Perception and Robotics.

The use of attention with CNN and NLP is obvious, but I also have ideas on how to turn it inwards.  After all, a movement is just a sequence of actions, and maybe this could turn 
into a digital sense of proprioception.

Or maybe I teach it math and let it just hit singularity for shits and giggles.
